# Generate Video

This project is designed to automate the process of video manipulation, including splitting videos into chunks, adding watermarks, and managing video files efficiently.

## Description

The `generate-video` project leverages `ffmpeg` to perform various video processing tasks. It checks for the existence of a primary video file and falls back to a backup video file if the primary is not available. The video is then split into chunks based on a specified duration, and a watermark is added to each chunk. The processed video chunks are saved to designated directories.
